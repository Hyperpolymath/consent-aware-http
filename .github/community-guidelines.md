# Community Participation Guidelines

Welcome to the Consent-Aware HTTP project. This repository advocates for ethical refusal, authorship dignity, and federated governance in AI-adjacent ecosystems. Together, we build protocols that don't just work — they respect.

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **Declarative Integrity**: Respect boundaries before assuming access
- **Ethical Comport**: Refusal is not obstruction — it’s authorship with clarity
- **Procedural Transparency**: No quiet permissions, no obfuscation
- **Creative Solidarity**: Your voice matters. So does everyone else's.
- **Zero Exploitation Tolerance**: No scraping, ghosting, gaslighting, or harvesting

## 🤲 How to Engage

- Speak with clarity, not domination  
- Credit sources and cite respectfully  
- Honor intent — ask before reuse, share with acknowledgment  
- Surface disagreements constructively, without derailing deliberation  
- Foster inclusivity and care across disciplines

## 🛠 Contribution Etiquette

- Issues are for bugs, insights, and improvement  
- Discussions are for exploration, clarification, and collaboration  
- Pull requests should describe reasoning, not just code  
- Questions are welcome, cynicism is not required

## 🕊 A Note on Refusal

This repo advocates for refusal as poise, not punishment. We welcome contrarian ideas — but not boundary erosion. We encourage critique — but not adversarial extraction.

If you violate authorship, erase intent, or harvest narratives unethically, you will be asked to leave.

## 🙌 Final Note

This is not just a repo — it's a perimeter. Enter with dignity, leave with respect, and build with care.

_“Ethical refusal is procedural comport.”_
