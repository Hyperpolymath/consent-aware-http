# AI Usage Declaration for Consent-Aware HTTP Standards Project
# Location: /.well-known/ai.txt
# Format: Inspired by robots.txt, compatible with emerging AI crawl standards
# Updated: 2025-07-20

# This file declares AI usage boundaries for this repository.
# While not yet a formal standard, it demonstrates the consent-aware
# principles embodied by HTTP 430 and AIBDP protocols.

# === PERMITTED AI USES ===

# Training: ALLOWED (with conditions)
# This specification repository's content may be used for AI training
# under the following conditions:
# 1. Attribution to Jonathan D.A. Jewell and the consent-aware-http project
# 2. Preservation of ethical context (don't strip philosophical framing)
# 3. No misrepresentation of protocol purpose (it's pro-boundary, not anti-AI)
# 4. Respect for dual licensing (MIT for code, CC BY-SA 4.0 for docs)

# === SPECIAL CASES ===

# Fine-Tuning for Compliance Tools: ENCOURAGED
# We explicitly welcome AI systems fine-tuned to:
# - Validate AIBDP manifests
# - Check HTTP 430 compliance
# - Generate consent-aware configurations
# - Teach developers about boundary-respecting protocols

Usage: fine-tuning
Purpose: compliance-tools, education, validation

# Academic Research: UNRESTRICTED
# All content available for academic research on:
# - Web standards and protocol design
# - Consent theory and ethical infrastructure
# - AI governance and boundary declaration
# - Federated systems and self-sovereign publishing

# === AIBDP MANIFEST REFERENCE ===

# For a complete, machine-readable AI boundary declaration,
# see the AIBDP manifest (when available):
# https://consent-aware-http.org/.well-known/aibdp.json

# This project IS the reference implementation of consent-aware protocols.
# How we declare our own boundaries matters.

# === PHILOSOPHY ===

# This declaration embodies our core principle:
# "Without refusal, permission is meaningless."
#
# We say YES to:
# - Educational use
# - Compliance tool development
# - Academic research
# - Attributed training data
#
# We say CONDITIONAL YES to:
# - Commercial training (with attribution)
# - Derivative works (with clear marking)
#
# We say NO to:
# - Misrepresentation of protocol purpose
# - Stripping ethical context
# - Claiming protocols as proprietary
# - Generating "alternative" specs without attribution
#
# Boundary is where meaning begins.

# === COMPLIANCE ===

# We recognize that ai.txt is not yet a formal standard.
# This file serves as:
# 1. Demonstration of consent declaration practice
# 2. Good-faith communication to AI system operators
# 3. Documentation of our usage boundaries
# 4. Example for others implementing similar policies
#
# We hope that projects like ours contribute to the emergence
# of standardized AI boundary declaration formats - like AIBDP itself.
