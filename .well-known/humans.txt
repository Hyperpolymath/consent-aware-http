/* PHILOSOPHY */

Core Principle: "Without refusal, permission is meaningless."

This project treats boundary-setting as a cultural practice, not just
a technical feature. It respects:
- Declarative refusal as care
- Transparent infrastructure over implied permissions
- Sanctuary work as procedural and cultural
- Authorship dignity in the age of generative systems

We are pro-boundary, not anti-AI.

/* META */

This humans.txt file is part of the consent-aware-http standards project.

We chose to include humans.txt because:
1. It acknowledges the human authorship behind protocols
2. It demonstrates transparency in attribution
3. It respects the tradition of making invisible labor visible
4. It aligns with our philosophical commitment to dignity

If you're reading this, you've found the human layer beneath the code.

Thank you for caring about boundaries, consent, and ethical infrastructure.

/* CONTRIBUTE */

We need:
- Protocol reviewers (IETF experience helpful)
- Reference implementation developers
- Documentation writers
- Ethical AI researchers
- Community organizers
- Translators
- Adopters willing to share their stories

See CONTRIBUTING.md to get involved.

Built with care, maintained with dignity, shared with hope.
