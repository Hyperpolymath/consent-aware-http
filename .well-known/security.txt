# Hiring
# This is a volunteer-driven standards project, not a commercial entity.
# However, we welcome collaborators and co-maintainers.

# Scope
# This repository contains:
# - Internet-Draft XML specifications (HTTP 430, AIBDP)
# - Documentation and educational materials
# - Reference implementation examples
# - Manifest schemas and validation tools
#
# Security concerns may include:
# - Vulnerabilities in reference code (validator tools, server middleware)
# - AIBDP manifest schema exploits (JSON injection, COSE signature bypass)
# - Documentation errors that could lead to insecure implementations
# - Protocol design flaws in HTTP 430 or AIBDP specifications
#
# Out of scope:
# - Third-party implementations not in this repository
# - General AI/LLM behavior (unless directly related to AIBDP violation)
# - Content of websites using HTTP 430 (report to those sites directly)

# Additional Context
# This project is rooted in consent theory and ethical infrastructure.
# Security vulnerabilities undermine trust in boundary-respecting protocols.
# We treat responsible disclosure as a form of care and collaborative dignity.
#
# "Without refusal, permission is meaningless."
#
# Thank you for helping protect consent-aware infrastructure.
