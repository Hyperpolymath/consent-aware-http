# Architectural Overview — Why Consent-Aware Protocols Matter

This is not just a spec. It's a cultural tool.

## 🔄 Problem

AI systems ingest public content without declaring scope or requesting consent. This erodes:

- Authorship intent
- Procedural boundary
- Ethical accountability

## 🧭 Our Response

**HTTP 430 + AIBDP** introduce:

- Declarative refusal using existing web semantics
- Manifest-based boundaries for AI-specific engagement
- Protocol clarity without legal bloat

## 🪧 Cultural Roots

Inspired by:

- bell hooks — boundary as dignity
- Woolf — architectural refusal
- Journalism — the right to decline co-option
- IndieWeb — federated publishing and self-authorship

## 🧬 Adoption Possibilities

- Personal domains
- Union archives
- CDN layers
- Academic repositories
- Web frameworks

AIBDP is not anti-AI — it’s pro-boundary.
